# A Doodle Drawing And Guessing Game!
Inspired by and designed using Google's [QuickDraw Dataset](https://github.com/googlecreativelab/quickdraw-dataset).

  - A multiclass classifier model (classifying from 10 categories) is deployed in the drawing part of the game. 
  - The guessing part displays sketches stroke by stroke from a MongoDB database (containing 44 categories).
